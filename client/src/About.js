Ai was born out of curiosity, appreciation for the hard work that people in the logistics industry put day in everyday, and the desire to serve our nation, again. In 2008, Rodolfo Valdivia, New York City native and son of immigrants, joined the Marine Corps, in gratitude for what this country did for his parents and his love for his country. After his deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan as a Motor Transport Mechanic, he was able to see first-hand that logistical operations were the heart-beat of mission accomplishment. 

After graduating college, Rodolfo wanted to switch gears and serve his nation again by working in finance, hoping to do his part to help strengthen the economy. Interestingly enough, while working in finance, he realized that as e-commerce continues to grow and our economy becomes more interconnected with other parts of the world, the logistics industry will only become more important to our economy's growth as we move forward.  While doing more research, he realized that this industry is constantly being challenged by huge demand to transport goods while facing shortage of truck-drivers and lack of technological innovation (besides testing self-driving trucks at the time).

Rodolfo knew all the hard work that professionals in logistics put in every day. In order to find a way to help these great men and women, and serve his nation again, he left his job in finance to become a truck-driver, drive over the road and conduct boots-on-the-ground research in order to identify problems and find opportunities to make peoples lives better. And from this up and close research journey, the logistical platform Log.Ai was born.

The team at Log.Ai takes its mission serious to serve the people in shipping, warehouse and carrier sectors, who make sure that our groceries, clothes, and gas (to name a few areas that the logistics industry enables in our everyday lives) are there when we needed it the most. We want to empower you to make collaborative, transparent and data-driven business decisions in real-time, enabling you to run your businesses in a proactive manner. In order to ensure that we deliver real practical value to you while you are conducting end-to-end logistical operations, we have built relationships with shipping, warehouse and carrier managers and business leaders. We are her to make sure that your efficient and productive levels increase so that you can provide a whole new level of customer service to your clients. </p>
